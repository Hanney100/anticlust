Tests:

- how do all methods deal with missing data?

---

Documentation:

- All exported function fully documented?

---


Implementation:

- function `anticlustering` should also take distance object as input
- complete enumeration as alternative to ILP for method = "exact" if 
  no solver is installed 

---

`anticlustering` arguments:

  - maybe include an argument list for adjusting ILP solver setting 
    (esp. verbose; alternative: a verbose option for all methods)
