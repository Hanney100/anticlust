Title: Subset Partitioning via Anticlustering
Description: Anticlustering partitions a pool of elements into subsets
    (i.e., anticlusters) in such a way that the subsets are as similar
    as possible. This is accomplished by maximizing instead of
    minimizing a clustering objective function, such as the
    intra-cluster variance (used in k-means clustering) or the sum of
    pairwise distances within clusters. Thus, anticlustering creates
    similar sets of elements by maximizing heterogeneity within
    anticlusters. `anticlust` implements exact and heuristic
    anticlustering algorithms as described in Papenberg and Klau
    (2019; <doi:10.31234/osf.io/3razc>). The exact approach requires
    that the GNU linear programming kit is installed. Exact and
    heuristic algorithms for classical clustering problems under size
    constraints (i.e., creating equal-sized clusters) are also
    implemented, as well as methods for (unrestricted or K-partite)
    matching.
