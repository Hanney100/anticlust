Description: Anticlustering partitions a pool of elements into subsets (i.e., 
    anticlusters) in such a way that the subsets are as similar as possible. 
    This is accomplished by maximizing instead of minimizing
    a clustering objective (such as the intra-cluster variance or the 
    sum of pairwise distances within clusters). The package includes 
    exact and heuristic approaches for anticlustering. The exact approach 
    requires that a linear programming solver is installed. The package 
    also offers methods for classical clustering problems under size 
    constraints, i.e., creating balanced clusters of equal size.
