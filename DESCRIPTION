Description: Anticlustering divides a pool of elements into subsets (i.e., 
    anticlusters) in such a way that the subsets are as similar as possible
    to each other. This is accomplished by maximizing instead of minimizing
    a clustering objective (such as the variance or sum of distances 
    within clusters). The package includes exact and heuristic approaches 
    for anticlustering. The exact approach requires that a linear 
    programming solver is installed. The package also offers methods 
    to classical clustering problems under size constraints, i.e., 
    creating balanced clusters of equal size.
