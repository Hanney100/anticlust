Title: Subset Partitioning via Anticlustering
Description: Anticlustering partitions a pool of elements into subsets
        (i.e., anticlusters) in such a way that the subsets are as
        similar as possible. This is accomplished by maximizing instead
        of minimizing a clustering objective, such as the intra-cluster
        variance or the sum of pairwise distances within clusters. This
        way, anticlustering maximizes the data heterogeneity within all
        clusters. The package includes exact and heuristic approaches
        for anticlustering. The exact approach requires that a linear
        programming solver is installed. The package also offers
        methods for classical clustering problems under size
        constraints, i.e., creating balanced clusters of equal size.
