Title: Subset Partitioning via Anticlustering
Description: A set of functions for anticlustering, matching, and cluster
    analyis. Anticlustering partitions a pool of elements into subsets 
    (i.e., anticlusters) in such a way that the subsets are as similar as 
    possible. This is accomplished by maximizing instead of minimizing a 
    clustering objective, such as the intra-cluster variance or the sum of 
    pairwise distances within clusters. Thus, anticlustering maximizes the 
    heterogeneity within anticlusters. `anticlust` implements exact and 
    heuristic approaches for anticlustering. The exact approach requires 
    that a linear programming solver is installed (gurobi, CPLEX, or the
    GNU linear programming kit). Functions for classical clustering problems
    under size constraints (i.e., creating equal-sized clusters) and 
    (unrestricted or K-partite) matching are also implemented.
