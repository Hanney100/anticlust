Description: Algorithms to solve the anticlustering problem,
    i.e., assigning elements to groups in such a way that the groups are as
    similar as possible. Includes exact and heuristics methods. The exact 
    approach requires that an linear programming solver is installed. 
    Also offers methods to solve clustering problems under specific size 
    constraints, i.e., creating clusters of equal size.
