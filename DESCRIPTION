Description: Anticlustering establishes groups of elements (i.e.,
    anticlusters) that are as similar as possible, reversing the logic
    of classical cluster analysis that creates groups that can be
    clearly separated. This package includes exact and heuristic
    approaches to solve anticlustering, making use of two different
    optimization criteria that both maximize group similarity. The exact
    approach requires that a linear programming solver is installed. The
    package also offers methods to solve classical clustering problems
    under specific cluster size constraints, i.e., creating clusters of
    equal size.
