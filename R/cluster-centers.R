#
# @param features A data matrix of element features
# @param clusters A numeric vector indicating cluster membership of
#     each element
#
# @return A matrix of cluster centers. Rows represent clusters and

  centers <- by(features, clusters, colMeans, na.rm = TRUE)
  do.call(rbind, as.list(centers)) # as.list for the case of only one feature
}

# Determine distances of n data points to m cluster centers
#
#
# @param features A vector, matrix or data.frame of data points. If a
#     matrix or data.frame is passed, rows correspond to items and
#     columns to features.
# @param centers A matrix of cluster centers. Each row corresponds to a
#     cluster and each column corresponds to a feature (this format is,
#     for example, returned by the function `stats::kmeans` through the
#     element `centers`).
# @param squared Boolean - compute the squared euclidean distance?
#
# @return A data matrix; columns represent clusters
#     and contain the distance to the respective cluster for each item.
