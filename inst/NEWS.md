# anticlust 0.2.4

The new version of anticlust includes support for constraints induced 
by grouping variables. 

- The `anticlustering` function now has an optional argument (`categories`)
  that can be used to induce categorical constraints
- `categories` can be a vector if there is is one grouping variable or 
  a matrix/data if there is more than one grouping variable
- Currently, `categories` can only be used with the random sampling 
  method (`method = "heuristic"`)
- `categories` overrides the value of `preclustering`; it is not 
  possible to use categorical and preclustering constraints at the same
  time
